# Image-Manipulation
This project is essentially based on image manipulation by creating different image filters consisting of effects due to change in RGB within a particular image file. This project was completed using the Zelle Graphics module on the Python Programming Language.. Different sectors within this project include creating a 2x2 grid which is achieved by making a list to organize which images go in the grid. This project also leads to making a filter which removes a green screen background and replacing it with an exotic beach background.
